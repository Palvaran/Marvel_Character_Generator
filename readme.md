The purpose of this Github is to document the progress of replicating out the character creation process in the role playing game Marvel Super Heroes from 1984. I wanted to start learning Python in a way that I could actually see the results in a way that was more personalized to my interests in Marvel Comics. From here, I will then link the Python project into Wordpress on my AWS LightSail Wordpress site.
